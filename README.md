# NFT Marketplace

## Project Description

The NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum that enables users to mint, list, and trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in a secure and transparent manner. The smart contract combines ERC-721 token functionality with marketplace features, allowing creators to mint unique digital assets and collectors to buy and sell them seamlessly.

This project implements a complete NFT ecosystem where users can create their own NFTs with custom metadata, list them for sale at their desired price, and participate in a decentralized marketplace without intermediaries beyond the smart contract itself.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize digital asset ownership and trading by providing a trustless, decentralized marketplace where creators can monetize their digital content and collectors can discover and trade unique digital assets. We aim to eliminate traditional barriers in art and collectibles markets while ensuring fair compensation for creators through automated royalty systems.

The platform envisions becoming a hub for digital creativity, where artists, musicians, game developers, and content creators can establish direct relationships with their audience and build sustainable income streams through NFT sales.
